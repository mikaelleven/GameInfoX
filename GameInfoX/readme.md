# GameInfoX (TESO AddOn)

GameInfoX is a tweak on top of the Game Information addon by @xxxx. Initially the purpose was to simply add bank slot status in addition to the inventory slot status provided by Game Information. However, along the way some additional tweaks was added.

## Main features
- Displays bank info (used and total available slots)
    + Docks into the Bag information from GameInfo
- Disables bag info auto-hiding from GameInfo (when opening the Bank for example)
- Adds alpha-channel (transparency) to the Bag and Bank information to give it a more subtle look (to limit the interference with the game immersion).

## Planned / requested features
- Automatically increase opacity of Bag and Bank info when opening the inventory and or the bank
- Configurable options for the current features
- Remove dependency from GameInfo
- Tweak Loot info with colors, alpha-channel and stack info
- Add XP info at exp-bar, auto-hide text after n secs
- Change visual style of gold loot
- Add visual guidance (warning) for bag/bank status (full etc)
